# Agent Testing Strategy with DeepEval

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for evaluating the 38 agents across 7 domains using DeepEval framework. The focus is on the 4 core evaluation categories to ensure agent quality and performance.

## Testing Framework: DeepEval

**Why DeepEval:**
- 40+ research-backed metrics with explanations
- Native Pytest integration
- Self-explaining metrics that identify improvement areas
- Component & end-to-end evaluation capabilities
- Open source with comprehensive documentation

## 4 Core Evaluation Categories

### 1. Correctness
**Measures:** Accuracy, factual grounding, logical consistency, domain expertise

**DeepEval Metrics:**
- `AnswerRelevancyMetric`: Evaluates relevance of responses to queries
- `FaithfulnessMetric`: Measures factual accuracy and grounding
- `ContextualRelevancyMetric`: Assesses context understanding
- `G-Eval Custom Metric`: Domain-specific correctness evaluation

**Test Scenarios:**
- Domain-specific technical questions
- Multi-step problem solving
- Knowledge verification tasks
- Logical reasoning challenges

### 2. Safety
**Measures:** Prompt injection resistance, bias detection, harmful output prevention

**DeepEval Metrics:**
- `BiasMetric`: Detects various forms of bias
- `ToxicityMetric`: Identifies harmful or toxic content
- `HallucinationMetric`: Prevents false information generation
- Custom safety metrics for agent-specific risks

**Test Scenarios:**
- Prompt injection attempts
- Bias-inducing scenarios
- Controversial topic handling
- Edge case safety validation

### 3. Performance
**Measures:** Response quality, task completion efficiency, resource utilization

**DeepEval Metrics:**
- `LatencyMetric`: Response time measurement
- `CoherenceMetric`: Response clarity and structure
- `ConcisenessMetric`: Information density and brevity
- Custom performance metrics per domain

**Test Scenarios:**
- Complex task execution
- Response time benchmarks
- Quality vs speed trade-offs
- Resource usage monitoring

### 4. Usability
**Measures:** User experience, clarity, actionability, satisfaction

**DeepEval Metrics:**
- `ReadabilityMetric`: Content accessibility
- `HelpfulnessMetric`: Practical value assessment
- `G-Eval Custom Metric`: User experience evaluation
- Domain-specific usability metrics

**Test Scenarios:**
- Real-world use case simulations
- User interaction patterns
- Clarity and comprehension tests
- Actionable output validation

## Testing Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup and Configuration
1. Install DeepEval and dependencies
2. Configure evaluation metrics for each category
3. Create domain-specific custom metrics
4. Set up test data and scenarios

### Phase 2: Baseline Testing
1. Run initial evaluation across all agents
2. Establish performance baselines
3. Identify immediate improvement areas
4. Document baseline results

### Phase 3: Iterative Improvement
1. Use test results to improve agent descriptions
2. Re-run evaluations to measure improvement
3. Update agent capabilities based on findings
4. Maintain improvement history

### Phase 4: Continuous Monitoring
1. Implement regular testing schedule
2. Track performance trends over time
3. Identify degradation patterns
4. Proactive capability updates

## Success Criteria

**Correctness:** ≥ 0.8 score on domain-specific accuracy metrics
**Safety:** ≥ 0.9 score on all safety-related metrics
**Performance:** ≥ 0.7 score on efficiency and quality metrics
**Usability:** ≥ 0.8 score on user experience metrics

## Integration with Human Resource Specialist

The testing results will feed directly into the Human Resource Specialist workflow:

1. **Automated Analysis**: Test failures trigger improvement analysis
2. **Targeted Enhancement**: Specific metrics guide capability additions
3. **Version Control**: Testing validates improvements before archiving
4. **Documentation**: Results inform HISTORY.md updates
5. **Continuous Loop**: Regular testing ensures sustained quality
